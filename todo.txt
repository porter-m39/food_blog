Bugs / things to fix
- weird "try out a sidebar" aside in index.html (in posts)
- when I list things, make it so that there's no comma after the last item in the list
- once you decide for certain you like the set-up with base2.html, rename it to base.html and delete the original base.html
- add ability to search coffees by roast level, cupping notes. Maybe acidity too?
- change score system so that different people can submit different scores
- change font. perhaps get rid of bootstrap altogether.
