Bugs / things to fix
- DONE -- weird "try out a sidebar" aside in index.html (in posts)
- DONE -- when I list things, make it so that there's no comma after the last item in the list
- DONE -- once you decide for certain you like the set-up with base2.html, rename it to base.html and delete the original base.html
- DONE -- add ability to search coffees by roast level, cupping notes. Maybe acidity too?
- DONE -- change score system so that different people can submit different scores
    - working on this now. Need to figure out how to improve this in models.py
    - improve Scores class, especially the class meta, so that it returns author + coffee + score
    - figure out how to display relevant scores on coffee details page
- DONE -- change font. perhaps get rid of bootstrap altogether.
- Make blog look nicer :/ 
    - New color scheme?
    - change the bold face font so that it's more readable
    - make nav bar better
- Fix search
    - Right now, I have separate searches for coffee and food. Make this into one search bar. I think for this, I need to rewrite the search.html file to index both recipes and coffees.
    - Fix coffee search so that it searches origin, comments, cupping notes, etc. (Could do something similar for food search too)
