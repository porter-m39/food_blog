Bugs / things to fix
- DONE -- weird "try out a sidebar" aside in index.html (in posts)
- DONE -- when I list things, make it so that there's no comma after the last item in the list
- DONE -- once you decide for certain you like the set-up with base2.html, rename it to base.html and delete the original base.html
- DONE -- add ability to search coffees by roast level, cupping notes. Maybe acidity too?
- DONE -- change score system so that different people can submit different scores
    - working on this now. Need to figure out how to improve this in models.py
    - improve Scores class, especially the class meta, so that it returns author + coffee + score
    - figure out how to display relevant scores on coffee details page
- DONE -- change font. perhaps get rid of bootstrap altogether.
- DONE -- Make blog look nicer :/ 
    - DONE -- New color scheme?
    - DONE -- change the bold face font so that it's more readable
    - DONE -- make nav bar better
    - DONE -- add search bar to the new "header"
    - DONE -- get rid of the "tab title" in base.html
    - DONE -- add border to the sidebar
    - DONE -- make it so that there's not an empty list of tags to the side when you search by tag 

- DONE -- Fix search
    - Right now, I have separate searches for coffee and food. Make this into one search bar. I think for this, I need to rewrite the search.html file to index both recipes and coffees.
    - Fix coffee search so that it searches origin, comments, cupping notes, etc. (Could do something similar for food search too)
- See if I can add formatting options for the comments/body of posts and coffees, such as italicizing text, having the option for bullet point lists, etc.
- DONE -- Export everything before I deploy
    - DONE -- Need to set up import/export options in coffee app
- Figure out the following: is there a way to configure the Country class so that if there are no coffees with a certain country listed as its origin, that country automatically gets deleted? Same for cupping notes & roaster. And tags for posts in the food app.
- DONE -- Clean up settings.py file
- DONE -- Figure out how to get pictures to always render
- DONE -- add media to .gitignore and delete all the photos on the repo
- Make website responsive, in that it renders differently on a phone versus a computer
     - DONE -- warm-up: make personal math website responsive 
- Add comment feature to posts
- add wash/natural process option for coffee model
